subroutine nmlsrc(name, iun, ifind)

    implicit none
    integer:: i, ifind, ilen, iun, j
    ! Subroutine NaMeList SeaRCh

    ! This routine searches the file on unit IUN for the namelist with name
    ! NAME. The namelist is denoted by a line where the first non-blank character
    ! string is either &NAME or $NAME.

    ! IFIND: 0 Namelist was not found. File will be rewound before return.
    !        1 Namelist was found. File will be backspaced to the line that
    !          contained the namelist flag before returning.

    ! Limitations: the namelist flat must fit entirely in the first 80 columns
    !              of the line on which it appears.

TASKS:

Urgent
1) make information from header a class and import all inputs
2) make a dictionary for elements to atomic numbers
3) separate function for collection time
4) more efficient array method for geometrical quantities, may be important for torque, r_cm, and v_cm
5) single call to one geometry analysis main module and then a class for geometry analysis functions
6) consistency in the flag names for NEXMD (rnd_seed, nucl_coord_veloc, etc.)
7) look into all tinit
8) restart needs a second call to header to update header.file before making new input files

Less Urgent
1) how to simulate pump-push-probe spectroscopy, possible convolution? Multiple pump-push delay times?
2) NEXMD program problem with restart - propagation of quantum degrees of freedom
3) add a function that calculates torque about a specific atom
4) add a function that calculates r_cm and v_cm
5) add a function that calculates IR spectra (autocorrelation of the dipole moment) - for adiabatic dynamics only?

| Currently, there are 12 main functions:                 |
|                                                         |
| (1) prepare inputs for single-point calculations        |
| (2) generate a combined optical spectrum from           |
| single-point calculations                               |
| (3) prepare inputs for non-adiabatic excited-state      |
| molecular dynamics (NEXMD)                              |
| (4) prepare input files for an adiabatic simulation,    |
| with geometries taken from NEXMD                        |
| (5) collect populations as a function of time from hops |
| and  quantum coefficients                               |
| (6) collect PESs and NACTs from NEXMD                   |
| (7) prepare restart input files for NEXMD               |
| (8) clean the directories of unfinished trajectories    |
| (9) access options for geometry analysis                |
| (10) access options for dipole analysis                 |
| (11) access options for transition density analysis     |
| (12) access code testing tools                          |
|                                                         |
| NOTE: Ground-state trajectory must be completed first.  |
| Coordinates and velocities are selected from a single   |
| ground-state trajectory. The files that contain         |
| coordinates and velocities are coords.xyz and           |
| velocity.out.                                           |
|                                                         |
| NOTE: Main output file from NEXMD program must be       |
| called 'md.out'.  Currently, this is how it is defined  |
| in the main submission script.  If this output file is  |
| renamed, 'md.out' in the 'collectceo.sh' script must    |
| be changed accordingly in order to generate an optical  |
| spectrum from single-point calculations.  Also,         |
| 'md.out' in 'optspec.py' must be changed.               |
|                                                         |
| NOTE: This script can generate a new set of random      |
| seeds or use a list provided by the user.  The latter   |
| option may be important for code testing or             |
| benchmarking purposes.  The user-defined list must      |
| strictly be a list of random seeds, with no header or   |
| footer, and the number of random seeds must be equal to |
| or greater than the number of trajectories requested.   |

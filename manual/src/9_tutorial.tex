\section{Tutorial}

This part of the documentation seeks to provide a more guided experience of running 
standard NEXMD2 calculations with questions and tasks to complete.

More complex research tasks can take guidance from getexcited.py documentation.

\subsection{Exercise 1: Ground state nuclear geometry energy minimization}
- Optimization in the GS

\subsection{Exercise 2: Single point electronic excitation calculation: transition density analysis}
- TD plotting for this structure

\subsection{Exercise 3: Ground state vibrational normal modes}
- GS normal modes calculation for this structure

\subsection{Exercise 4: Finite temperature nuclear geometry conformation sampling from Langevin dynamics}
- Langevin dynamics for generating a conformational sampling

\subsection{Exercise 5: Electronic absorption spectra prediction from conformation sampling}
- Absorption spectra calculation from the conformational sampling

\subsection{Exercise 6: Non-adiabatic molecular dyanmics with trajectory surface hopping}
- TSH dynamics for a subset of the conformational sampling and plot of the excited state populations
